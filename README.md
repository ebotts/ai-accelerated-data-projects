# AI-Accelerated Data Projects

This is a portfolio of data analysis projects built using a human + AI workflow. I use ChatGPT to accelerate early exploration — generating data, simulating scenarios, or shaping ideas — and then apply my own expertise to validate, visualize, and extract insight.

### 🔄 My Process
1. **Start with a question** – What am I curious about?
2. **Use LLMs to accelerate** – Simulate, ideate, or enrich
3. **Apply core skills** – Clean, analyze, and visualize
4. **Communicate** – Deliver insights through dashboards or storytelling

These projects are designed to showcase strategic thinking, data fluency, and a clear understanding of where automation ends and human judgment begins.
